# DODA: Dynamically Orchestrated Dataflow Architecture (Protected Verilator Library)

Welcome to the protected Verilator library for the **Dynamically Orchestrated Dataflow Architecture (DODA)**! This repository contains an example dataflow graph that demonstrates a map-reduce operation, showcasing the power and flexibility of DODA. Alongside the Verilated library, a C++ testbench is included to facilitate simulation and experimentation.

## What's Inside
- **Protected Verilator Library**: A secure, pre-compiled Verilator library for simulating the DODA architecture.
- **Example Dataflow Graph**: A simple graph that first performs a **map** function and subsequently applies a **reduce** function.
- **C++ Testbench**: A complete C++ testbench to simulate the map-reduce graph on DODA.

## Experiment and Explore
Feel free to tweak the input dataflow graph to experience the versatility of DODA. Imagine the possibilities:
- **Accelerate Chip Design**: Rapidly prototype and iterate on new chip designs.
- **Offload CPU Workloads**: Shift computationally intensive tasks to DODA, relieving the CPU.
- **Runtime Reconfiguration**: Dynamically reconfigure DODA at runtime, adapting to new tasks on the fly.

With DODA, the limits of conventional architecture no longer constrain you. Explore new frontiers in computing!

## How to Compile and Run
### Compilation:
